// Task:
// A magician in the subway showed you a trick, he put an ice brick in a bottle to impress you. The bricks top and bottom are square with sides equal to the bottles diameter. The bricks fits snuggly up to the bottle neck/rim. Just for fun and also to impress the magician and people around, you decide to calculate the brick's volume. Write a function iceBrickVolume that accepts these parameters:

// radius - bottle's radius (always > 0);
// bottleLength - total bottle length (always > 0);
// rimLength - length from bottle top to brick (always < bottleLength);
// And return volume of ice brick that magician managed to put into a bottle.


// Note:
// All inputs are integers. Assume no irregularities to the cuboid brick. You may assume the bottle is shaped like a cylinder. The brick cannot fit inside the rim.

// Examples:
// iceBrickVolume(1, 10, 2); // => 16
// iceBrickVolume(5, 30, 7); // => 1150

function iceBrickVolume(radius, bottleLength, rimLength) {
    // Your code should be here ;)
    
    return (bottleLength-rimLength) * (radius**2) * 2
  }
