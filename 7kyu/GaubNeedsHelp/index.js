/* 7kyu
Due to another of his misbehaved, the primary school's teacher of the young GauÃŸ, Herr J.G. BÃ¼ttner, 
to keep the bored and unruly young schoolboy Karl Friedrich Gauss busy for a good long time, while he 
teaching arithmetic to his mates, assigned him the problem of adding up all the whole numbers from 1 
through a given number n.

Your task is to help the young Carl Friedrich to solve this problem as quickly as you can; so, he can 
astonish his teacher and rescue his recreation interval.

Here's, an example:

f(n=100) // returns 5050 
It's your duty to verify that n is a valid positive integer number. If not, please, return false (None for Python, null for C#).

Note: the goal of this kata is to invite you to think about some 'basic' mathematic formula and how you can do 
performance optimization on your code. 

Advanced - experienced users should try to solve it in one line, without loops, or optimizing the code as much as they can.

Credits: this kata was inspired by the farzher's kata 'Sum of large ints' . In fact, it can be seen as a sort of prep kata for that one.

function f(n){
  return Number.isInteger(n) && n > 0 ? (n * (n + 1)) / 2 : false;
};

console.log(f(100));        // returns 5050
console.log(f(300));        // returns 45150
console.log(f(50000));      // returns 1250025000
console.log(f('n'));        // returns false, n must be a number
console.log(f());           // returns false, n must be a value
console.log(f(3.14));       // returns false, n must be an integer
console.log(f(0));          // returns false, a value of n greater than 0 is required
console.log(f(-10));        // returns false, a positive value of n is required


/*================ other solution ======================
function f(n){
  return (parseInt(n) === n && n > 0) ? n*(n+1)/2 : false;
};
